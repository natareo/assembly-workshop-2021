workshop overview

+ IRL only, no livestream
+ let's cap at 90

Distribution Hall in Austin
one large hangar, one part set up for A/V w/ seating & speakers
Cristina handling logistics
getting herringbone seating
another side hangar too (capacity? A/V? no climate control?)

logistics of orders
* when is ultimatum date for printing?
  - if nicer, if need design, will need soon
  - reference material
* an email sooner rather than later about course (intention etc.)

* projection capability while speaking
+ they do have temporary walls for acoustic damping
* decamping to the other room for psychological separation
