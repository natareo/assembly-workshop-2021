##  Prolegomena

You have received two sticky notes, a handout package, and a nametag.

The sticky notes are our way of diagnosing local problems.  That is, if you or your team is stuck or something is broken, raise the red flag and a helper will swing by and get your system set straight again.  When you are done with an exercise and ready to move on, raise the green flag so we can keep a quick visual glance at how the room is going.

Put down your preferred name on the nametag and introduce yourself to your neighbors.  You'll be working together and you'll be spending a lot of time together so may as well break the ice!
