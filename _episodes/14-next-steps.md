##  Joining the Urbit Developer Community

### Contributing

The Urbit ecosystem is primarily developed by Tlon Corporation and a host of open-source contributors.  The types of projects which you can contribute to include:

1. End-user applications (“userspace”, `%gall`) (this workshop)
2. Operating system functionality (Arvo & vanes)
3. Runtime (king/serf, jets)

As the Urbit developer community grows, there will be opportunities as well for various types of services, ranging from service hosts to star and galaxy owners.

The Tlon [contributor's guide](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) largely focuses on kernel contributor discipline, but provides a good framework for approaching development of any part of the ecosystem.

If you have not participated in an open-source project before, please check these resources as well:

Most of my work here has been in the software engineering context. I usually recommend these books:

Though perhaps a bit dated (most companies know they're in the software business in some capacity nowadays)
