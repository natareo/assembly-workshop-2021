> ##  Building `%delta` to Count Pokes
>
> _This entire section is a team exercise.  You should work in a GitHub repository to which you all have access and employ basic pair programming to talk through your solution process._
>
> Your team's objective is to update the `%charlie` agent to a new `%delta` agent, which does the following:
>
> 1. Accept remote pokes from another ship.  Pokes should be either increment or decrement requests.
> 2. Upon receipt of an increment request, increment a count in a map of `@p`â†’`@ud` for each ship.  Add the key if necessary.
> 3. Upon receipt of a decrement request, decrement the corresponding counter.
> 4. In either case, print the resulting value on the local ship and send a poke to the remote ship to make it print the result as well.
>
> > ##  Hints
> >
> > - While it is possible to set up a remote Urbit testnet, for our purposes it is simpler to test the agent using two (or more) fakezods on a single computer.  (You can also use several comets on the live network.)
> >
> >     Of course, since you can only have _one_ `~zod`, you should pick another ship (galaxy, star, or planet).  Use `@p` on any unsigned integer for inspiration, then boot a new clean ship and backup as on Day One.
