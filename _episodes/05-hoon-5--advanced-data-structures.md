##  Data Structures
\labsec{he:data-structures}

\subsubsection{Units}
\labsec{he:unit}

Every atom in Hoon is an unsigned integer, even if interpreted by an aura.  Auras do not carry prescriptive power, however, so they cannot be used to fundamentally distinguish a \texttt{NULL}-style or \texttt{NaN}-style non-result.  That is, if one receives a \sig~back from a query, how does one distinguish a value of zero from a non-result (missing value)?

Units mitigate this situation by acting as a type union of \sig~(for no result) and a cell \texttt{[\textasciitilde~u=item]} containing the returned item with face \texttt{u}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=nonumbers]
++  unit
  |$  [item]
  $@(~ [~ u=item])
\end{lstlisting}
