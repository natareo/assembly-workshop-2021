Assembly as developer retreat/focus
- you can confidently build on Urbit now
- one cool thing to do is teach a workshop (2-day)
- they fly me out + admission etc.
- Urbit Entrepreneur model (32 stars to form a team and build a thing)
+ I can help w/ %khan if I like
- ~8 hours total
- incorporate software distribution so make a %gall app
- foundations on Day One (13h30–18h00, 4½ h)
- app on Day Two (about the same time, 11h40–17h00)
- what's the starting point?
- %gall app (Roam clone?)
+ switch tutorials to start w/ "install this desk"
- Jake + Mark working on designing developer experience of software experience
- workshop ñ have to start at event
- could we livestream
- we don't know how many people will be able to come (soft target 100–250)
+ need to get me up to speed on the new software distribution methodology
+ need to get bigger funnel on dev pipeline
- give concrete product for them to do at the end
