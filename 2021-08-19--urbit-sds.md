[~littel-wolfur sez working w/ Tlon is fantastic, better than any job he's had before]
how do I go from a written %gall app to a distributed one?
the unit of distribution is a desk
threads, generators, apps, marks, sur, helper routines, static files, etc.
|public %mydesk
  will make it available to be downloaded by other ships
|install ~lagrev-nocfep %mydesk
  downloads desk, reads manifest file w/i desk & starts agents
  creates subscription to my ship for any updated desk to download & merge locally
[what about front-end JS etc.]
from kernel perspective that's just about it in steady-state operation
a couple of other pieces need to be built to get this to work w/ kernel kelvin versioning & Landscape
thus Grid
Landscape uses globs but we'll make userspace-friendly; will get from other ships directly
(still a point of some contention)
%kiln
base desk has kernel code, dojo, hood (`|`) [helm, drum, kiln], azimuth-tracker, a few other necessary services that you want only one of and that you want universally available
%kiln deals with %clay & tracks installs
%kiln doesn't know about %landscape, which will be distributed separately
home screen is a landscape feature not a base feature
%grid has %docket (manifest)
manifest is structured mark of metadata
link unfurling w/ desk link will automatically connect
[what about memory size]
show all available exposed desks (grid-compatible desks, "apps")
includes which JS files should be fetched using %glob system so they can be served from ship
loom can fill up quickly, too many changes hard-to-diff w/ JS : thus can't store in %clay!
  thus %glob but may go into %docket
basic idea is that hash of files is map of path to file data of all JS etc.
  hash goes into the manifest so when grid installs it fetches
user clicks tile in UI then opens URL of file inside %glob
docket agent is in grid desk → should be in base desk? not sure yet
user-facing problem is that if implemented naïvely then you may have desk & tile before %glob finishes then it can't load
  race condition can be an issue, not resolved yet
kernel issue will be resolved now by announcing early to make compatible versions
