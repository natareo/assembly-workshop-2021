- The most effective learning is mimetic: it either directly demands productivity or engages the mirror neurons. Most of the workshop should be hands-on, either as a live-coding exercise following the instructor directly or as guided exercises. This is fairly demanding to administer (in case anything goes wrong on a learner's workstation), so we need at least one helper per 25 participants.

- If students are working on their own machines, we can either expect them to run a fakezod directly or run one on the cloud.

- The rhythm of teaching should follow these principles:

    - Have no more than 15–20 minutes of instruction without a break.
    - Formative assessments should take place about every five minutes
    - About every third or fourth formative assessment should take 5 minutes.
    - 5-minute exercises should be carried out in groups of 3–5 students.
    - About every hour there should be a short break.  Encourage standing and walking about.
    - Breaks should become slightly more frequent as the afternoon wanes.

- Learn names.  Track participation and try to engage everyone.

- Have students introduce themselves to each other at the beginning.

- Encourage pair programming as the normative experience.

- Have helpers keep you on track time-wise (with breaks etc.).

- Use different color terminal windows for different sessions to help students visually distinguish.

- Read out what you are typing.  Use the [aural ASCII convention](https://web.archive.org/web/20200215032029/https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/hoon/hoon-syntax/).

- Use a shared document (such as GDocs) for sharing longer code blocks.  (Make sure your preferred mode doesn't chomp Hoon whitespace).

- Take care of your voice.  Let the microphone amplify.  You have to last for 9+ hours!

- Use questions:  https://www.polleverywhere.com/activities
